            <h2 class="disease-title">VIBRIOSIS</h2>
            <p class="disease-description">Vibriosis in shrimps is a common bacterial disease caused by gram-negative, oxidase-positive, motile rod bacteria.
                Affected shrimp larvae exhibit necrosis of appendages, expanded chromatophores, empty gut, and poor feeding, with cumulative mortalities reaching up to 80% within a few days.
                Microscopic demonstration confirms the disease in shrimp larvae, and preventive measures involve maintaining water quality and reducing organic load through increased water exchange.</p>

        <p class="disease-description">Shrimps with black gill disease display visible brown to black spots on the gills, and in severe cases, complete gill discoloration with atrophy and necrosis is apparent.
            Black gill disease can result from various factors, including excessive levels of toxic substances like nitrite, ammonia, and pollutants in the water.
            Prevention involves addressing specific causes; for pollution-related cases, improving pond water quality is essential.

        <h2 class="disease-title">WHITE GUT</h2>
        <p class="disease-description">White gut disease in shrimps is characterized by a white or translucent appearance in the digestive tract, particularly the gut, commonly referred to as "White Gut."
            It leads to a loss of appetite, lethargy, and high mortality rates in affected shrimp populations. 
            Essential preventive measures include ensuring proper nutrition, effective water quality management, and the implementation of disease prevention strategies to address and mitigate the risks associated with white gut disease in shrimp.

        <h2 class="disease-title">WHITE SPOT SYNDROME (WSS)</h2>
        <p class="disease-description">White Spot is a highly contagious viral infection in shrimp, leading to significant mortality in cultured populations.
            It is characterized by the appearance of white spots on the exoskeleton and affects multiple organs, leading to high mortality rates. 
            Effective prevention strategies involve implementing strict biosecurity measures, regular health monitoring, and measures to prevent the introduction and spread of WSSV in shrimp farms.
            WSD is primarily caused by the highly contagious and lethal White Spot Syndrome Virus, contributing to elevated mortality rates in shrimp.
